# UHI

This small project was done in the context of the CO3: Optimisation Methods module of the Master's programme in Applied Computational Life Sciences at ZHAW in Zurich. 
The project concerns a simple implementation of two optimisation algorithms: Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimisation, applied to a simplification of an urban heat map. The objective of the optimisation is to disitribute urban vegetation, respecting budget and location constraints, to minimise the overall temperature of the map and the temperature of heat islands
